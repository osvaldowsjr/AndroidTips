To save states on android app:
  - Android may destroy your activity if:
    - Not enough memory
    - Rotate screen
    - Turning off the screen for a long time
  - To avoid that you can use:
    override fun onSaveInstanceState
      -> Use the outState bundle to save information that you want to persist with your state
    override fun onRestoreInstanceState
      -> savedInstanceState would work as the same bundle as outState bundle of onSaveInstaceState
